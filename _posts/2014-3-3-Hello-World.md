## Overview
In this post, I will describe how [gamerpuppy](https://github.com/gamerpuppy) and I found an unwinnable Slay the Spire seed along with a simple proof of unwinnability.  This project is motivated by ForgottenArbiter's success at finding a (probably) unwinnable seed.  Our goal was to find a seed for which it can be proven unwinnable without simulating combat, and without checking too many cases.  

## Previous progress
